<h1>Conducting a Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of conducting an internal security audit for a fictional company by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
The audit will help ensure that security checks are made and monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect the organization's business continuity and critical assets. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of its security posture. 
<br />
<br />
This project starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. Next, the project focuses on completing a controls and compliance checklist. Lastly, the project focuses on providing a summary of recommendations to the IT manager regarding which controls and/or compliance best practices Botium Toys needs to implement based on the risk posed if not implemented in a timely manner. These recommendations are made so my IT manager can communicate to stakeholders to reduce risks to assets and improve Botium Toys’ security posture.
<br />

<h2>Scenario</h2>
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as its main office, storefront, and warehouse for its products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, its information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support its online market worldwide. 
<br />
<br />
The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

<h2>Botium Toys: Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report</h2>
<h3>Scope and Goals of the Audit</h3>
<b>Scope:</b> The scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.
<br />
<br />
<b>Goals:</b> Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys’ security posture.
<br />

<h3>Current Assets</h3>
Assets managed by the IT Department include: 
<br />
- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs.
<br />
- Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
<br />
- Storefront products available for retail sale on-site and online; stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse.
<br />
- Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, e-commerce, and inventory management.
<br />
- Internet access.
<br />
- Internal network.
<br />
- Data retention and storage.
<br />
- Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring.
<br />

<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
<h4>Risk Description</h4>
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 
<br />
<h4>Control Best Practices</h4>
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identifying assets so they can be appropriately managed. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.
<br />
<h4>Risk Score</h4>
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.
<br />
<h4>Additional Comments</h4>
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure. Review the following bullet points for specific details:
<br />
- Currently, all Botium Toys employees have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII.
<br />
- Encryption is not currently used to ensure the confidentiality of customers’ credit card information that is accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in the company’s internal database. 
<br />
- Access controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented.
<br />
- The IT department has ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure data integrity.
<br />
- The IT department has a firewall that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
<br />
- Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department. 
<br />
- The IT department has not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS).
<br />
- There are no disaster recovery plans currently in place, and the company does not have backups of critical data. 
<br />
- The IT department has established a plan to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours if there is a security breach. Additionally, privacy policies, procedures, and processes have been developed and are enforced among IT department members and other employees to document and maintain data properly.
<br />
- Although a password policy exists, its requirements are nominal and not in line with current minimum password complexity requirements (e.g., at least eight characters, a combination of letters, and at least one number; special characters). 
<br />
- There is no centralized password management system that enforces the password policy’s minimum requirements, which sometimes affects productivity when employees/vendors submit a ticket to the IT department to recover or reset a password.
<br />
- While legacy systems are monitored and maintained, there is no regular schedule in place for these tasks, and intervention methods are unclear.
<br />
- The store’s physical location, which includes Botium Toys’ main offices, storefront, and warehouse of products, has sufficient locks, up-to-date closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance, and functioning fire detection and prevention systems.

<h3>Recommendations</h3>  
Multiple controls need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys’ security posture and better ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information, including: Least Privilege, separation of duties, disaster recovery plans, backups, password policies, a password management system, an IDS, ongoing legacy system management, and encryption.
<br/>
<br/>
To address gaps in compliance, Botium Toys needs to implement controls such as Least Privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. The company also needs to properly classify assets and identify additional controls that may need to be implemented to improve its security posture and better protect sensitive information.
<br/>

<h3>Explanation of Recommendations</h3>

<h4>Least Privilege:</h4>
Currently, all employees have access to the company's internal and customer data. The principle of Least Privilege needs to be implemented so users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks. This is to reduce risk and the overall impact of a breach.

<h4>Separation of Duties:</h4>
There are currently no controls for the Separation of Duties. This needs to be implemented to reduce the possibility of fraud/access to critical data and reduce the risk and overall impact of malicious insiders or compromised accounts.
<h4>Disaster Recovery Plans & Backups:</h4>
There are no disaster recovery plans in place. These need to be implemented, and the company needs to start periodically backing up critical data to ensure business continuity in the case of a breach.

<h4>Password Policies:</h4>
Employee password requirements are minimal, which could allow a threat actor to more easily access secure data or other assets via employee work equipment or the internal network. The enforcement of password policies will reduce the likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attacks.

<h4>Password Management System:</h4>
No password management system is currently in place; implementing this control would improve the IT department and other employee productivity when password issues occur.

<h4>IDS:</h4>
There is currently no IDS installed. The IT department needs an IDS in place to help detect anomalous traffic that matches a signature to identify possible intrusions by threat actors.

<h4>Ongoing Legacy System Management:</h4>
The list of assets notes the use of legacy systems. The risk assessment indicates that these systems are monitored and maintained, but there is not a regular schedule in place for this task, and procedures/policies related to intervention are unclear, which could place these systems at risk of a breach. The implementation of ongoing legacy system management is necessary to identify and manage threats, risks, or vulnerabilities to out-of-date systems.

<h4>Encryption:</h4>
Encryption is not currently used; implementing it would provide greater confidentiality of sensitive information, like customer credit card information and PII.

<h4>Asset Classification:</h4>
Current assets have been inventoried/listed, but not classified.
